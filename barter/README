Adds a dialog option to chat with stalkers and trade your gear.

Creates up to three random trades per stalker that allows the player to exchange one quantity of items they have for another - food, meds, ammo, grenades, supplies and carried loot. Items bartered are dependent on faction, with rank WIP.

If a stalker asks for a multi-use item, the multi-use item given must have all uses intact to be traded. Conversely, stalkers will give you a full multi-use item.

Included is a tweak to the tables for Weapon Parts Overhaul that scales up the value of weapon cleaning supplies proportionate to their increased value in WPO.

Please report any bugs or crashes. I haven't tested this much but this is a pretty easy addon to remove.
